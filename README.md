## Description

Ticketmaster is a Selenium WebDriver script created for Google Chrome that allows UMG Support Specialists to accurately and efficiently resolve disputes and tickets in the resolution center. The dropdown with a list of canned responses is replaced with a clean and easy to use panel of buttons, making it easy to resolve and autocomplete a ticket with the click of a button.
